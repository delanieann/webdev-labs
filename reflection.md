## Reflection Document

### HTML

This section was fun to work with. The examples from the slides made it easy to understand what is expected. The biggest issue was having broken links when trying to use the placecat.com and placedog.com. Thankfully the bear image worked.

### Accessibility

The accessibility exercises were very interesting. It made it clear that you can write very barebones HTML but really, it's not useful for everyone.

## CSS
This is a fun section, I generally enjoy working with CSS. It can take some trial and error to get to the end goal because I am still new, but I enjoyed completing these exercises. The most difficult were the last two.

## Flexbox

I enjoyed this exercise with CSS. The flexbox is incredibly powerful, and I enjoyed the fractional element which makes creating layouts simply.
