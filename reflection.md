## Reflection Document

### HTML

This section was fun to work with. The examples from the slides made it easy to understand what is expected. The biggest issue was having broken links when trying to use the placecat.com and placedog.com. Thankfully the bear image worked.

### Accessibility

The accessibility exercises were very interesting. It made it clear that you can write very barebones HTML but really, it's not useful for everyone.
